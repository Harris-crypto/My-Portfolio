          <h1> Hello! I'm Harris Rasmussen. </h1>
          
          <p>I'm starting my journey as a software engineer while living in Sonoma County, also known as Sonoma County. </p>
        
            When not sipping on a fine glass of Cabernet, you may be able to find me doing a few of the following:   
          <ul>
            <li>Going on hikes through local redwood forrests</li>
            <li>Driving to the beach with old friends</li>
            <li>Researching potential investments in the stock market</li>
            <li>Listening to Flume's new music album</li>
          </ul>

	   <h2> About Me </h2>
       
         
          <p> As an aspiring developer, I first joined <a href="https://www.thinkful.com.html">Thinkful</a> after a couple of my friends told me that I should look into software engineering crash courses. I have always been interested in coding, but up until now I've always viewed it as some sort of black magic! </p>
          <p> My most recent job was working as a metrology technician, helping manufacture optics for aerospace companies through a company called Alluxa. This was my first exposure to coding and working with computers as a job, and I loved it. </p>
          <p> I would love to further explore the mechanics of complex coding! </p>
